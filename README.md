# Manim Animations

This repository contains a collection of animations I created using **Manim**, a mathematical animation engine written in **Python**.

These animations were built to explore and visualize various concepts, including:

- 2D and 3D graphs  
- Animated geometric objects  
- Multi-dimensional structures  
- Custom scenes like CPUs and logos

## Highlights
- **Python-powered animations**  
- Uses **Manim** for mathematical visualization  
- Includes `.py` scripts, media assets, and rendered output samples  
- Feel free to explore, copy, or improve upon any of the files

## Folders & Files
- `Machine/`, `media/` â€“ Resource directories  
- Example scripts:  
  - `2d_graph.py`  
  - `3d Dots.py`  
  - `Animated_3d.py`  
  - `LaserCPU.py`  
  - `Pomu_Scene_v2.py`

## Requirements
- [Manim](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html)  
- Python 3.7+

This repo was part of my experimentation with visual storytelling through code.
